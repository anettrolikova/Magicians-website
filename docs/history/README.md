# About Ethereum Magicians 
Ethereum Magicians is a group of individuals working and contributing to the Ethereum and maintaining the forum. We aim to strengthen our role as a community moderator by organising meetups with Ethereum Core Developers and Researchers and wide Community during bigger Ethereum Conferences. Which have a very positive impact on the whole Ethereum Community, empowers Ethereum Core decision makers listen to community more and encouraging researchers to work closer with the community via Ethereum Magicians Forum. 

Ethereum Magicians started as a group of individuals who wanted to have a *noise free* platform for discussions about technical difficulties in Ethereum mainly about [Ethereum Improvement Proposals] (http://eips.ethereum.org/)  . So we built Ethereum Magicians forum on discourse. We formed Working Groups that we started to call Rings to have discussions about different topics. Currently we have around 22 different Rings formed on a forum. Anyone can create Topic and join the discussion without unwanted noise that's provided on social media platforms (Crypto Twitter, Reddit, chat platforms).
We have built an online community but we wanted to foster the conversations more so we decided to organise Ethereum Magicians Council. 
As time flies, Ethereum Magicians role is evolving in the community. We became more like community driven self-organised group of people who are helping organise in-person meetings and support community.
