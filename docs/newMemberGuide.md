## This document is to guide you as you get started in the Ethereum Magicians forum.It is explaining terms used in Ethereum Magicians Community :sparkles:

### Fellowship of Ethereum Magicians (FEM) was founded to solve the problem of offline and online coordination in Ethereum. We started an open forum with a focus on improving Ethereum without unwanted noise (that social media like Twitter and Reddit provides). FEM is a Fellowship of individuals with a common goal - Improve Ethereum. If you’re interested in the history of FEM, read this article from Pet3rpan.

# The Community :sparkles:
Ethereum Magicians is a community of individuals who are contributing to Ethereum. On Ethereum Magicians forum you can find Ethereum Researchers, Core Devs, Builders, dApp devs and You.

# The Forum :fax:
Everyone is more than welcome to participate in the forum. You can join the discussion with GitHub account, email or create a new login to participate. You don’t need to log in to read the discussions. You can use direct messages on a forum too.

# The Discussion :speaking_head:
Main purpose of the Ethereum Magicians forum is to have discussions around Ethereum Improvement Proposals and give The Community place to have discussions about other topics connected to the growing Ethereum ecosystem.

# Rings :ring:
Rings are working groups formed around topics that the community is discussing. 
Every Ring has it’s own Ring leader - that’s usually the most active person in ring discussion or the one that started a topic. Nowadays a lot of rings are not active anymore and we are working on keeping Etherum Magicians forum as up-to-date and active as possible.

# Gatherings :busts_in_silhouette:
Ethereum Magicians believe not only in building online community but in an offline community too. It’s important to meet people offline and talk to people face to face when we are building and working on a project together. That’s why Ethereum Magicians are organising Councils a few times a year usually around bigger Ethereum conferences and blockchain weeks. We are organising Councils as a bigger meeting where the community gathers and talks about the biggest problems that we all are facing. Council is usually recorded and there are notes from it. Ring meetings - those are individually organised meetings usually happening after Council. Ring meetings are self-organised by ring leader where are concentrated discussions about a certain topic.

# Operations Ring :man_technologist: :woman_technologist:
This ring is responsible for organising events - in-person meetings, moderating discussions and more. We are there to help out. You can imagine Operations Ring as a help desk. Currently, people who are in charge of the Operations Ring are @jpitts and @anettrolikova.

# Our Ethos :scroll:
The Magicians are guided by a proposed Mission, Principles, and Practises that you can find in this document.
