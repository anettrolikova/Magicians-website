# Ethereum Magicians 
Ethereum Magicians is a group of individuals working and contributing to the Ethereum and maintaining the forum. We aim to strengthen our role as a community moderator by organising meetups with Ethereum Core Developers and Researchers and wide Community during bigger Ethereum Conferences. Which have a very positive impact on the whole Ethereum Community, empowers Ethereum Core decision makers listen to community more and encouraging researchers to work closer with the community via Ethereum Magicians Forum.
